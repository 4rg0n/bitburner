## Extension Recommendations
[vscode-bitburner-connector](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode) ([vscode extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bitburner.bitburner-vscode-integration)) to upload your files into the game

[vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) to use live linting in editor

[auto-snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.auto-snippet) to automate inserting the file template in `.vscode/snippets.code-snippets`

There is a workspace file in `.vscode` which contains the recommended settings for all of these

## Dependencies
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) required for compiling typescript and installing dependencies

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/bitburner-official/vscode-template
npm install
npm run defs
```

## How to use this template
Write all your typescript source code in the `/src` directory

To autocompile as you save, run `npm run watch` in a terminal

To update your Netscript Definitions, run `npm run defs` in a terminal

Press F1 and Select `Bitburner: Enable File Watcher` to enable auto uploading to the game

If you run `watcher.js` in game, the game will automatically detect file changes and restart the associated scripts

## Imports
To ensure both the game and typescript have no issues with import paths, your import statements should follow a few formatting rules:

 * Paths must be absolute from the root of `src/`, which will be equivalent to the root directory of your home drive
 * Paths must contain no leading slash
 * Paths must end with no file extension

 ### Examples:

To import `helperFunction` from the file `helpers.ts` located in the directory `src/lib/`: 

```js
import { helperFunction } from 'lib/helpers'
```

To import all functions from the file `helpers.ts` located in the `src/lib/` directory as the namespace `helpers`:

```js
import * as helpers from 'lib/helpers'
```

To import `someFunction` from the file `main.ts` located in the `src/` directory:

```js
import { someFunction } from 'main'
```

## Deugging

For debugging bitburner on Steam you will need to enable a remote debugging port. This can be done by rightclicking bitburner in your Steam library and selecting properties. There you need to add `--remote-debugging-port=9222` [Thanks @DarkMio]

When debugging you see errors like the following:

```
Could not read source map for file:///path/to/Steam/steamapps/common/Bitburner/resources/app/dist/ext/monaco-editor/min/vs/editor/editor.main.js: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/path/to/Steam/steamapps/common/Bitburner/resources/app/dist/ext/monaco-editor/min/vs/editor/editor.main.js.map'
```

These errors are to be expected, they are referring to the game's files and the game does not come packaged with sourcemaps.
